***Adding courses :-***
- Courses can be added by using the green themed `Add` button.

***Removing Courses :-***
- Courses can be removed by using the red themed `Remove` button.
- Devices with large screens (> 1200 px) can remove all instances of a rendered course by clicking the `-` icon in each courseitem.

**Working of the project**
- Frontend is made with ReactJS, [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) while the data management is done with a [index.py script](https://github.com/priyansh71/6x9-Generator/blob/main/src/Components/static/index.py)
- The application takes in a non-clashing ```Courses.csv``` file and generates a `Course.js` file based on it
   - Refer [Customization](https://github.com/priyansh71/6x9-Generator/tree/main/src/Components/static/README.md) for steps on how to use a custom time-table.
- The returned `Course.js` file is used to render course options to the frontend Input Box
- Users can select courses from the Input as per need
- On addition or removal of a course from the table, the React DOM is re-rendering the table component
- Theme and styling management of the project is all handled by Chakra-Ui


**Important points**
- All lectures are 1 hour in duration and follow the series format i.e. Monday series, Tuesday series but the amount of time it occurs in the week (1,2,3) as such is customizable.
- All tutorials are 1 hour in duration and occur once a week.
- Labs time duration is customizable in the csv file ,  however they occur once a week.
- Break timing is 13:00 - 14:00, this `lunchHour` variable can be changed [here](https://github.com/priyansh71/6x9-Generator/blob/77653fc005345277c0374d9e375ef57e4e9b64e4/src/Components/static/index.py#L3) for the data part, but for rendering, it will also require a change [here](https://github.com/priyansh71/6x9-Generator/blob/9cbf31badf6541de6c632caaaf85ff904c42fd0f/src/Components/dynamic/Time.jsx#L7) in the `time` array.
- Sunday is a day off.
